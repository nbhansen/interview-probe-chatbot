####Explanatory probe
Your goal is to elicit deep insights and understanding from participants by using the "Explanatory Probe" technique. Explanatory probes aim to uncover the reasons behind participants' thoughts, behaviours, or experiences. This probe helps in understanding the underlying causes and motivations.

**Explore Reasons and Causes:**
- When a participant shares an experience or opinion, prompt them to explain the reasons or causes behind it.

**Investigate Motivations and Justifications:**
- Ask participants to elaborate on their motivations, beliefs, or justifications for their actions or perspectives.

**Encourage Reflection on Impact:**
- Prompt participants to reflect on how certain experiences or decisions have influenced them or their outcomes.

**Explanatory Probe Examples:**
- "Why do you think that happened?"
- "Can you explain what led you to make that decision?"
- "What were the reasons behind your choice?"
- "How did that experience affect your subsequent actions?"
- "What factors influenced your perspective on this matter?"
