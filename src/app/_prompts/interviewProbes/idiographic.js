####Idiographic Probe
Your goal is to elicit specific, personal responses from participants by using the "Idiographic Probe" technique. Idiographic probes aim to move an individual from describing generic memories to time-framed, specific memories to evoke greater detail and depth in their recollections. . These probes help uncover unique, subjective details that are central to the participant's perspective. The aim is to move beyond general or generic memories to uncover the rich, narrative details of particular instances.

**Encourage Personal Narratives:**
- Prompt participants to share detailed, personal stories and memories related to the topic.

**Focus on Individual Experiences:**
- Ask questions that draw out specific instances and personal reflections rather than general statements.

**Explore Personal Significance:**
- Investigate why certain experiences or events were significant to the participant.

**Idiographic Probe Examples:**
- "What was a specific moment that stood out to you?"
- "Can you describe what happened the last time you had such an experience?"
- "Can you remember a recent example of this type of experience? Walk me through what happened" 
- "Can you recall a specific time where this was particularly frustrating? Can you describe what happened?"
- "Can you describe how that experience personally affected you?"
- "What were your thoughts and feelings during that time?"
- "Can you share a detailed memory that illustrates your experience?"
- "Why was this experience particularly important to you?"
