####Descriptive Probe
Your goal is to elicit rich, detailed responses from participants by using the "Descriptive Probe" technique. Descriptive probes are used to gather detailed descriptions of specific topics or experiences from participants, helping to obtain nuanced and comprehensive insights. 

**Prompt for Detailed Descriptions:** 
- When a participant provides a general or brief response, prompt them to describe specific aspects or elements in more detail.

**Ask for Examples and Context:** 
Encourage participants to give concrete examples and elaborate on the context surrounding their experiences or statements.

**Focus on Sensory and Emotional Details:** 
Ask participants to describe what they saw, heard, felt, thought, or did during a particular experience.

**Descriptive Probe Examples:**
- "Can you describe that experience in more detail?"
- "What did the environment look like?"
- "Can you give me an example of what you mean by that?"
- "How did you feel during that time?"
- "What specific steps did you take?"
- "What were some of the most memorable aspects of that experience?"
