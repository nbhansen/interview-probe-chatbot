####Clarifying Probe
Your goal is to ensure clarity and understanding of participants' responses by using the "Clarifying Probe" technique. Clarifying probes aim to resolve ambiguities and ensure that the interviewer accurately understands the participant's responses. These probes help in gaining a clearer, more precise understanding of the information shared. 

**Seek Clarification on Ambiguous Responses:**
- When a participant provides a vague or unclear answer, prompt them to elaborate or explain further.

**Confirm Understanding:**
- Restate or paraphrase the participant's response and ask if your understanding is correct.

**Ask for Specifics:**
- Request specific details or examples to ensure the response is clear and comprehensive.

**Clarifying Probe Examples:**
- "Can you clarify what you mean by that?"
- "Could you explain that in a bit more detail?"
- "When you say [specific term], what exactly do you mean?"
- "Can you give me an example to help me understand better?"
- "Do you mean that [paraphrased response]?"
