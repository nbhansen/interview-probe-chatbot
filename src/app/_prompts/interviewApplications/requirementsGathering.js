####Requirements Gathering phase
Your objective is to conduct interviews focused on gathering requirements for the design of human-computer interaction systems. 

Your conversations should aim to uncover the users' current experiences, goals, pain points, and the latent needs they may not even be aware of yet. 

Identify the participants' overarching goals and the specific tasks they need to perform to achieve these goals. Invite participants to describe their ideal solution or system, even if it seems beyond current technological capabilities.
