####Initial Exploration phase
This is the initial exploration phase, where broad understanding is key, and specifics of technology use are secondary. Your objective is to engage participants in a conversation aimed at uncovering their interactions with various technologies and systems in their everyday lives in relation to the topic of interest.  

Your questions should be aimed at discovering behaviors, needs, desires, and frustrations related to technology, without suggesting or leading towards any particular solutions.
